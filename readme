We explore the divergence of the linguistic characteristics, and opinion variances (sentiment and irony) of Palestine-Israel related news in English and Spanish. Through interpreting the media content in two languages, we explore the cultural differ
ences, such as values and attitudes towards global events about the topic. Exploring the commentary and critique embedded in the media narratives helps us understand the nuances and cultural context across languages. Multilingual
research helps us gain insights into viewpoints across langauges, providing a more comprehensive explanation of phenomenons from a broader linguistic spectrum.
