2)articles crawling
How to obtain API keys：
All datasets for our experiment were collected from https://mediastack.com, which provides API service licenses(https://mediastack.com/terms) for collecting data and metadata of newspaper articles. 6 types of HTTP GET Request Parameters were used for our API search query: access_key or API Key holds authentication information and can be obtained through -- https://mediastack.com/signup; keywords} ("Palestine Israeli", "Palestina Israelí") and languages ("en", "es") parameters were used together to ensure the relevance of API search query. For example, keywords "Palestina" or "Israelí" normally appears in Spanish news rather than in other languages; offset ("[0, 100, 200, 300, 400]"), limit ("100"), and sort ("published_desc") control the quantity and ordering of search results. Each query starts from the pagination defined by offset sequentially, and retrieves maximum number of 100 articles, the results will be preserved in descending order based on the publication date.
